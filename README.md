# Re-arrangement and Reinforcement neural network

First, you should download the dataset using the url in "./dataset/*".

Second, you should set the dataset path in "main.py".

Finally, you can run "main.py" to evaluate model performance.

## Regarding our experiment of integrating the R&E network into existing CNN-based methods: 
The source code URLs for five existing CNN-based prediction methods (ST-ResNet, ST-GSP, SaConvLSTM, DeepSTN+, and CRNN) are provided in their respective folders' "readme.txt" files. Our plugin R&E network can be found in the above-mentioned code under the class name "Arranger."

Furthermore, we also provide two GNN-based and two Transformer-based methods (MC-STL, ST-SSL, iTransformer, and PatchTST). You can modify the dataset paths and evaluate their performance accordingly.
